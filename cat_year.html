                <p id="paragraph">The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is the only
                    domesticated species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown
                    that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a
                    house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued
                    by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws it is
                    adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes,
                    sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.</p>
